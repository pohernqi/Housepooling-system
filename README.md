# Housepooling-system
The roles of housepooling system include owner, tenant, admin and searcher. All actors
have functionalities to register for an account, login to the system, manage their profile, and
view property details. The owners are able to view the property details in the manage
property section, which also provides features for owner to add property, update property
and delete property. The newly added and updated property will then be sent to admin for
approval. Owner can also manage lease. For existing lease, owners can choose either to
renew or terminate the lease. Owners can also create new lease for new tenants.
As for the searcher, they are able to scroll and view the property list that is offered by visiting
the website. They may view the details of the property that they are interested in. There are
also options for them to book timing to view the property by selecting a slot that is available
for the viewing. If they decide to officially become a tenant, they need to register for an
account and can manage their profile there.

The Admin oversees and manages various crucial processes within the system. They serve
as a key moderator, responsible for reviewing and approving property listings uploaded by
the Owner. Additionally, the Admin manages reviews, ensuring compliance by reviewing and
deleting Tenant reviews when necessary. They possess the capability to view booking
schedules between Owners and Searchers. In cases where conflicts arise in booking
requests or discrepancies occur, the Admin acts as a communicator, engaging with involved
parties to find a resolution. Furthermore, the Admin plays a pivotal role in managing leases,
being able to view lease details between Owners and Tenants. They also act as
user support, having the authority to manage role change for tenants wanting to become an owner.
As part of their responsibilities, the Admin handles financial oversight, ensuring
accurate and complete management of financial transactions.

The tenants are basically the customers who rent the property. After the searcher finds a suitable
property, they will then become a tenant that will rent the property. The tenant can renew or
terminate their lease by communicating with the owner. Deposit payments will be made by the
tenant when they have a new agreement . They can also make reviews of the property for other
tenants or searchers to see whether the property is suitable or not. If the tenant decides to become
an owner, they can submit their application to the admin, with the condition that they can only be
accepted for role change if they do not have a late payment history or an active lease.
